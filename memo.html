	</center>

	<h1>Underlying assumptions:</h1>

	<p>
	   A memo is usually an internal an internal working paper written to share information and/or instructions among peers,most often those working for the same organisation or those working together on a common projectevn though they represent different organisations.Because they are informal working papers,memos are rarely sent to outsiders,especially those younor your company wants to impress.A business letter is consideredmore formal,more more forceful an more imressivethan a memo.
	</p>

	<p>
	   Because they are written to people who are involvesin or at least familiar with your work,your organisation and the standard practiceof your profession,memosuses an informal style in which jargon,abbreviations and short-form references to people and organisations are acceptable.
   </p>

	<p>
		Most memos request specific informations, response to previous questions,share new information,or give instructions to do something.They may also be written to create"paper trail"for future references.
	</p>

	<p>
	    <b>Note</b>:In recent years and in many organisations,e-mail has increasingly taken the place of hard copy memos.in fact the basuc format of e-mailis a direct adaption of memo format.consequently,many of the guidelies for writing e-mail and for memo writing are usually interchangeable.

	<h1>Working tips:</h1>

	<ul><br>

	<li>
		  keep the reader in mind as you write and make the memo as conversable as possible.	
		</li>

	<li>Keep it short and focused.its often n=more effective to write a series of short memos,with one topic per memo,rather than one long one.Procter & Gamble.e.gconsiders one -page memo the norm.
		</li>

	<li>
		The topic should be evident in the subject line and be immediately addressedin the first paragraph.
	</li>

	<li>
		Present the main idea of your memo or make your request before spending time on an explanation,If backup details is necessary,state the key point first and den fill in the background.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Explain references fully enough to avoid
		</ul>
	</li>
