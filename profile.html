		Born in Onitsha in 1961, Obi graduated from the University of Nigeria in 1984. Afterwards he entered business and banking, eventually holding several executive positions at banks. Obi ran for governor in 2003 as a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, but Chris Ngige was declared winner of the election.[5] In 2006, the election of Chris Ngige was nullified and Obi was declared winner of the 2003 election, and he assumed office in March 2006. He was impeached in November the same year by the Anambra State House of Assembly, led by Hon. Mike Balonwu, but his impeachment was overturned and he returned to office in February 2007. Obi was removed after the 2007 Anambra State gubernatorial election, but the judiciary again intervened by ruling that he should be allowed to complete a full four-year term. In 2010, he was re-elected to a second term.[6][7]

		After leaving office in 2014, Obi decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party.[8][9][10] In 2019, he was selected as the PDP vice presidential nominee in the presidential election running alongside Atiku Abubakar but the ticket lost to incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari and vice president Yemi Osinbajo.[11][12][13][14][15] In 2022, Obi ran for president himself, first in the PDP until defecting to the LP in May 2022 to obtain its nomination. Obi's presidential campaign has been described as populist and has been noted for its support among many young Nigerians, who have been nicknamed "Obidients".[16][17][18][19]
